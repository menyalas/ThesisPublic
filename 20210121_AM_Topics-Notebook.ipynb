       " 'You will understand this phrase better as you read along.': 3,\n",
       " 'The streets are straight and wide, because crooked, narrow lanes would not suit the commercial purpose; they are all cut at right angles, running North, West, East and South — for a purpose.': 2,\n",
       " 'How could a stranger possibly familiarize himself quickly with the location of a place in which he is interested in so large and mountainous a city, the houses of which, particularly in the outskirts, resemble anything but a continuous line and where the many vacant lots make it almost impossible to use numbers effectively?': 0,\n",
       " 'You commence to realize that the founders and early city fathers laid their plans for a purpose and, moreover, for a good one.': 3,\n",
       " 'Having read so far you will now reason thus: If San Francisco has wide, straight streets and large squares, it must be a beautiful city.': 2,\n",
       " 'Slowly, I pray you!': 0,\n",
       " 'Do not judge too hastily.': 3,\n",
       " 'This is a new country and San Francisco is of the latest birth, in what is commonly known as the \"Wild Western\" region.': 1,\n",
       " 'Everything consequently is yet done for a commercial purpose, and beauty, so far, counts for little.': 2,\n",
       " 'And still one has to admit San Francisco has its attractions.': 3,\n",
       " \"Though the appearance of the city, were I to describe a bird's-eye view from one of the hill tops is not a very symmetrical one, nor does it present to us the beautiful architecture of ancient Greece, but one finds therein a rare liveliness and an ever changing aspect.\": 2,\n",
       " 'San Francisco compares with Berlin as a bright, rosy-cheeked maiden might be compared with a marble Juno.': 4,\n",
       " 'No two houses have a similar front; not ten are alike in general architecture.': 4,\n",
       " 'Each house has its peculiarity, indicating the taste and nationality of its owner and is built in accordance with the requirements of the respective material used.': 0,\n",

       " 'The materials used differ as much as do the countries which their styles represent.': 1,\n",
       " 'Most buildings are of wooden material, many others of brick, iron, zinc and copper.': 2,\n",
       " 'Brick houses with metal roofs, iron doors and window casings are very much the style here and those who are able to afford the great outlay generally favor the latter, because they offer better resistance in case of fire than any of wholly metal structure, which have proven impracticable during great conflagrations.': 2,\n",
       " 'It is said that the intense heat of some big fires has softened the metal built houses to such an extent that they became almost useless.': 0,\n",
       " 'There is no way of repairing such damage to metal built houses as the wages for building mechanics, no matter what metal they work in, are so enormously high that the repairs would cost much more than the importation of a new structure from England or the Eastern States.': 0,\n",
       " 'The streets which run through this gay appearing map of edifices are still very hilly, but time will change that easily and soon enough.': 0,\n",
       " 'As soon as the American finds out that hills do not suit his purpose, he will find means of moving them without much ado.': 1,\n",
       " 'He will not try to bring that about like Mohammed, by faith, but by machines of the most varied and unheard-of construction, which, however, have or seem to have all one common feature, that of being very much \"for the purpose.\"': 1,\n",
       " 'One of said machines is at present working at leveling a sand hill, about one hundred feet high, near Rincon point, the Southern end of the harbor.': 2,\n",

       " 'Behind the tents the ground rises again to a second terrace, about as high as the first, thus forming a gently sloping elevation covered with short grass, and here and there a bit of brushwood; the ridge itself being a constant change of gently undulating hills and dales, and the whole forming the outermost link between the Sierra Nevada and the vast, boundless savanna, where the mighty Sacramento — a stream as broad as the Elbe — in its slow course absorbs its numerous tributaries.': 2,\n",

       " 'The forward or lower end of the box is open, only a narrow lath — 1¼ or 1½ inches wide — is nailed across it at the bottom; this is called the \"riffle.\"': 2,\n",
       " 'The modus operandi is very simple.': 0,\n",
       " 'A bucketful of dirt, with stones and all, just as you have loosened it with the pick, is thrown on the sieve, and then while you set the rocker in motion with the left hand, with a dipper in your right you pour water over the dirt on the sieve.': 2,\n",
       " 'As soon as the soil is washed off the stones these are thrown out and a second bucket of dirt is thrown on the sieve, and this again is treated like the first, and so on until you have washed about 20 or 25 bucketfuls.': 2,\n",
       " 'By the motion of the rocker the gold and heavy sand are collected on its bottom, while the lighter stuff is washed off over the riffle; this lighter stuff we call \"tailings.\"': 2,\n",
       " 'The residue which has collected on the bottom of the rocker is now very carefully scraped together at the rear end of it, is then treated again to three or four washings, and now we have the gold mixed only with some black ferruginous sand, but free from all other matter; it is now taken up and thrown into a tin or sheet-iron pan — a pan about 4 inches deep, in diameter about 16 inches on top and 12 inches at the bottom.': 2,\n",
       " 'The last work before evening is then to wash in this pan the black sand off the gold, a procedure requiring much dexterity, the sand being almost as heavy as the gold itself, so that one not used to the work, is apt to wash away gold and sand together.': 2,\n",
       " 'Any grains of sand which, on account of their being too heavy, we cannot separate from the gold by washing, we get rid of by first drying the whole thoroughly; then we put it on a small tray and blow the sand away.': 2,\n",
       " 'In reading this description you will not think that our labor is as heavy as it really is.': 4,\n",
       " 'Believe me, it is as exacting, mechanical labor as can be done; and is intensely so to one not accustomed to manual labor.': 2,\n",
       " 'The hard stony soil has first to be loosened with a pick; then the larger stones — often so heavy that they can hardly be moved, have to be rolled aside; next the dirt must be shoveled together, and must then be carried to the rocker.': 2,\n",
       " 'Now consider that we have to remove the top dirt before we reach the soil in which we find the gold; (on the place where I am at work now I have to remove 5 or 6 feet of rocks — at times even more) that I have to carry daily 40 or 50 pails of water a distance of from 200 to 300 yards over rough, loose rocks, that we have to work in narrow holes or shafts from 6 to 10 feet deep, where one never feels a draught of air, but where he is exposed to a sun so hot that he can hardly touch the stones with his hand; if you think of that you will concede that to chop wood is in comparison with this, justly considered to be light work.': 2,\n",
       " 'But one gets used to everything, and so have I got used to this work, which now is not half as hard on me as it was at first, though I am able to do almost as much again as I did at first.': 0,\n",

       " 'Yet I am making more money than many others, because I attend to my work in an even way without hurrying or exerting myself too much.': 0,\n",
       " 'Almost of the same construction as the rocker above described is the \"bullrocker,\" only with this difference that it is larger, generally 2 feet wide and about 6 feet long, and that the iron sieve which covers the whole length of it is open at the lower end, so that the rocks after being washed will by the motion of the rocker drop off by themselves, and the sieve needs not to be emptied, by hand, as with the small rocker.': 2,\n",

       " 'About 15 inches below this sieve is placed the riffle box, which is of the same width, but about 8 feet long, and divided into two parts by nailing a piece of lath about 1½ or 1¾ inches wide across it; the rear portion is about 5 feet, the front portion about 3 feet long.': 2,\n",
       " 'It requires 3 men to work a Long Tom.': 0,\n",
       " 'Two of them loosen the ground and throw it into the sluice box, into which a stream of water is conducted which in washing the rocks carries them also forward and on the sieve.': 2,\n",
       " 'On this sieve  the stones collect, and from here the third man removes them with a shovel; everything else goes through the sieve and into the riffle box, where the gold and the black sand are deposited, while the lighter stuff is carried off as tailings.': 2,\n",
       " 'With these machines you have the advantage that you are able to wash a great deal of soil with them.': 1,\n",
       " 'While one man alone can with a rocker, under the most favorable conditions, when water is close by and the dirt easily picked, wash at best only about 250 bucketfuls, 3 men with a Long Tom can easily handle from 12 to 15 hundred bucketfuls.': 2,\n",
       " 'The Double Long Tom differs from the single only in that it has two sieves instead of one — a second and finer sieve being placed about 6 or 8 inches below the first, and that the riffle box, instead of two is divided into 3 or 4 parts, the two at the rear end being placed about 6 inches higher than those in front.': 2,\n",
       " 'The Double Long Tom is mostly used where very fine gold is found, which it more effectually saves than do the other machines.': 1,\n",
       " 'Such are the tools we work with; they are rather rough and primitive; and rough and primitive is the life we lead.': 0,\n",
