       "[' dear ones, i am sending this letter to you with heartfelt greetings. i always look forward to saturday, because we ride into town to see if we don\\'t have any letters waiting for us there. and someone always remembers us and i am very glad of that. we believe what you say about the sale of our property, because i know myself how that goes; that the sale will not be made until the harvest, that we know, because i think you are constantly going to have to be concerned with the crops. but it can be sold after harvest, but we cannot determine the price for you; however, you have heard what they were offering me for it, so judge by that the more it brings, the better for us. we are leaving it completely up to you, uncle, because we know that you understand these things and that you will want to get the highest price. vavrín said that if you get a buyer other than florián, you should sell it for a hundred less. but if there isn\\'t any other buyer, vavrín says florián should add some to the sum he had proposed to me. we will also send you an authorization either with this letter or directly after it. and then, when and if it sells, should you want or need a witness, tell uncle horácek from krenovice, i have already written to him about it. we don\\'t want to push you, but we would be glad if it could be done by winter, so we could buy something here. and then too, here there are sales on everything, livestock and farming machinery, where we can get everything and much more cheaply, because the farmers are moving someplace else and are selling everything. we want to buy about six to eight cows, because that pays off, you can make your livelihood from that. now we have two cows, both of which have calved. we have a centrifuge and so i churn butter, this week i made six and a half kilograms, but here it is cheap, one pound for twenty cents. (one pound is just shy of a half-kilogram.) but back home the cows don\\'t have so much cream. whenever i churn butter, i am amazed at what kind of butter comes out, if i had had such butter back home, what money i could have earned! but then there it costs less to support yourself, so it comes out about the same. i have to tell you something about how grazing is managed here, you can\\'t imagine how it\\'s done. first of all consider that that one 160 acre tract is comparable in size to all those claypits including the pasture land up to the cross near the road to zbejsov. now about 20 to 30 acres are used for grazing, and there the livestock grazes all summer, and it is surrounded by barbed wire so they can\\'t go any farther. the hayfield is separate; the livestock can\\'t go there. when the corn comes in, the livestock will graze there and they spend all summer and all winter outside, here that is the custom, so they aren\\'t cold. the cows are with calf as at home and usually calve in the spring, so the calves usually are full-grown by winter. here calves are not sold and young heifers cannot even be sold for slaughter. i wish you could see how it is here. i was afraid before we got our first calf and wanted vavrín to go to the cow and help her. but he didn\\'t want to, so that the cow would not be frightened. so she calved outside, and it didn\\'t even last an hour, the cow was already leading the calf out to the pasture, it was still wet, got up on its two front legs and was already drinking. it is really peculiar how resilient the livestock is here. but here a calf drinks from its mother for only one or two days and then it is led off to the stable, where it is given as much milk as it wants. that\\'s because it would otherwise suck on its mother constantly, even when it should already be weaned, and the cow would kick it when it approached her. i thought i had already written you about the corn. the grass is also growing, but they don\\'t worry themselves about that in america. the corn has good soil, in a short time it will outgrow the grass and it\\'s \"olrajt\" [czech rendering of \"all right\" trans], that is to say, it\\'s okay; i\\'m already writing like an american. it\\'s ploughed over one or two times and then it\\'s left until the crop is harvested. when it is cut, then it is so dry that only the ears are harvested, without the stalks, that is left completely. and then it is either sold immediately or hauled off to be stored in piles. for this we have bought a round sort of wire that is very tall, into which the ears of corn are thrown. these piles are then covered with hay on top and then the corn stays good all winter. they don\\'t shuck corn here before it\\'s sold; the whole ear is sold as is. a lot of corn is raised here. they make flour and spirits out of it and any number of other things. but it is completely different from the corn back home; it is similar to hungarian corn. harvest time has already come here, they are already cutting rye and wheat, there isn\\'t any barley here and the oats are still green. on saturday we drove into town, where they were cutting rye, so we watched them do it. they cut it with a machine that also bound the barley, it would turn out about five sheaves at a time, one person put these into piles and then all that was left was a field full of stubble. that\\'s the american way of doing things. vavrín said that you have to uproot some apple trees in the garden and give them to grandpa pouchlý. and i wrote to mother in krenovice that she should go there and take for herself whatever is there. also, in case mr prerovský wants that oven, sell it to him, and if not, then let mama take it back to krenovice. we are giving mother strítecká 3,000 crowns. she will keep 2,000 and give 1,000 to the boys. vavrín and i just agreed that the property could bring in 500 crowns measure for measure and the house 8,000. i am writing that it could, whether it will or not we don\\'t know; this, uncle, you alone will know. you know better than we what debts we may have and where, and you also will understand how to carry out the sale. you will have plenty of difficulty with it, but i think that you won\\'t be offended when i tell you that we don\\'t want to give it away. we will gladly compensate you for everything, only when i didn\\'t have to sell it until now, when i have tried to [sic]. i am already getting used to life here, i am happy and very pleased with this farm of ours. our sows now have nine piglets and two of them are about to farrow. also, we have one new horse. we are doing well and hope that god will give us continued good health. i still have to tell you about the biggest american holiday. it\\'s the fourth of july, that is freedom day, on the calendar it\\'s called independence day. on that day no one is allowed to do anything, and everywhere there is singing and merrymaking. things are pretty merry here, too, but, i think, different than back home. when we come back sometime i will tell you about everything. here, these farmers are not so overworked as back home, and particularly their wives. whether it\\'s a sunday or a weekday, they always ride around dressed like ladies, on excursions or into town. we are already getting used to going on visits, too. nobody goes anywhere on foot here at all, everybody drives or is driven. our farm is near the road, and there are always buggies driving on it, i haven\\'t seen anyone walking by yet. so what are you all up to? are you all healthy? greet the nováks and the hlaváces for us, grandpa pouchlý\\'s family, mr prikrý\\'s family; all of us and jeník send our best. the stríteckýs ps a big kiss from r&uringzenka for the children. auntie, i could tell you so many things, but that can\\'t be, so sometime else. greet my aunt u for me and write me whether that neighbor of yours is healthy. ',\n",
       " \" dear friends, first of all, greetings from all of us and best wishes for the new year. once again i must inform you that we are still on earth, although sometimes it seems to me to be somewhere on the very edge. why don't you write us? you are already forgetting, only i do remember and at least from time to time write something. i am sending you likenesses of our children which r&uringze took with her camera. and in the picture that has the cattle you will find vavrín on the hay and i am standing there, this is how livestock is fed here and also pigs, but we have already sold a wagonful of cattle and 40 hogs, though we still have upwards of 30 left. and what are you all up to, dear ones? how are your children? write us soon, we are interested in everything, but hardly anyone writes us, everyone is forgetting about us, only i still remember my homeland and all the dear ones there. i am writing nine letters today, so this must be brief. greetings to you all, to nováks, to r&uringze and her husband from vavrín and marie strítecký the children also say hello! \"]"
