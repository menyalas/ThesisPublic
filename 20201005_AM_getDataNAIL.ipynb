      "Heinrich Rienermann. It was a wonderful trip, back on firm ground, traveling through\n",
      "beautiful country in a free nation. In Wheeling we had to wait a week for our wagons. Bruns\n",

      "near Cincinnati we ran on a stump. Since the river was very low, we were pleased to be able\n",
      "to continue our trip on the little steamer Cavalier. My husband became sick and was very ill-humored.\n",
      "I was with the child in the ladies' cabin and could not always be with him. And the\n",
      "food was bad since the steamer was overcrowded. For the first time I tried to express myself\n",
      "in English and with some success. I was able to persuade the black cook to take me to the\n",

      "to St&dot Louis a year before. St&dot Louis had approximately seven thousand inhabitants at that\n",
      "time. There we purchased the most necessary things for our immediate needs, and then we\n",
      "traveled on the Missouri up to Jefferson City. Our companions had traveled on different\n",
      "steamers to Osage City. We went up the Osage River to the mouth of the Maries on flatboats.\n",
      "Now there were only the Zellerhof family and the maid with us. We disembarked at Mr&dot\n",
      "Henry Dixon's inn. Our things had been unloaded near the penitentiary, and there our\n",
      "people found some shelter until the new friends from Westphalia came from Lisletown to get\n",
      "us. I was shocked at their appearance, genuine backwoodsmen in rough clothing and prepared\n",
      "for rough work. They were the Messrs&dot Huber, Gramatica, Höcker, and others. It\n",
      "was certainly a great omen that they welcomed us in this manner. And they probably had\n",
      "very little choice. A wagon covered with a tarpaulin had arrived. Mr&dot John Shipley took us\n",
      "\n",
      "through thick and thin, often without any road, to his parents' farm on the Osage River. The\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I continue telling my story I shall say that this area remained our home for over\n",
      "fifteen years. In joy and sorrow, frequently ill, we lived there. We endured our often difficult\n",
      "fate, and among ourselves we were happy to have many children. We had brought Hermann,\n",
      "our oldest, along.\n",

      "the sparse furnishings. Before evening we had already taken care of our meal and our lodging\n",
      "for the night. Gradually we were as comfortably settled as possible. The carpenter for the\n",
      "house that we were planning to build made an additional bedframe to shove under the bed\n",
      "for our girl, and with his assistance a lean-to for the boxes was made of split boards. My\n",
      "brothers lived for the time being with us. My brother-in-law, Hermann, had already bought\n",
      "a place on the Little Maries. The carpenter Kolk and his wife, brother-in-law David, and big\n",
      "JanUlysses and his helper, Keiser, lived in a small cabin about a mile from the location we chose for\n",
      "our house. In the beginning we were supplied with bread and milk from there. The winter\n",
      "was upon us, and my brothers brought in firewood. Pigs had already been fattened for us,\n",
      "and they were soon butchered. Then we got a cow and soon thereafter our first riding horse.\n",

      "Our first visit to Mr&dot Hesse's upset me very much. The lady took Bruns aside, cried, and\n",

      "No doubt Mr&dot Hesse himself was to be blamed that he wasn't doing so well. He had\n",
      "brought with him a teacher, a secretary, workmen, and a maid. He wanted to establish a\n",
      "distillery at a time when there weren't even fields there. As soon as the people began to claim\n",
      "American wages, it didn't work. He would have liked to have seen it through and worked\n",
      "and become a surveyor. This was a big setback in our expectations. But as it often happens,\n",
