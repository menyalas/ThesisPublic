       " 'The twelfth brought various indications of near-by land, such as the dark-green color of the water, diving ducks (duckers, as the sailors commonly call them), gray birds about the size of our geese.': 1,\n",
       " 'There also appeared floating alongside of our boat the limb of a tree, covered with leaves, a most convincing and welcome proof that the days of our journey were numbered.': 2,\n",
       " 'At about a quarter to one, the same afternoon, the joyous shout of land rang out from the fore top, whence the high coast could be observed, both in a Northern and Eastern direction.': 1,\n",
       " 'Soon after we commenced to notice the outlines with the naked eye, as they appeared at considerable length on the Eastern horizon.': 4,\n",
       " 'The sea grew calmer and the air warmer.': 2,\n",
       " 'As darkness set in we, of course, lost sight of the situation.': 0,\n",
       " \"By four o'clock the next morning we found ourselves close to the Farallones Cliffs and had hard work to keep the ship away from them, in which attempt we were particularly fortunate, as the moon shone brightly during that beautiful night.\": 2,\n",
       " 'However, we were compelled to reverse our course, and as the wind changed considerably back and forth during the early morning, we had quite a lively time on board.': 2,\n",
       " 'Though the sunrise was simply magnificent, the wind blew severely.': 0,\n",
       " 'The high coast of California appeared to be but twelve miles away, while the Farallones cliffs were now almost as far distant, when looking from our backboard-quarter.': 1,\n",
       " \"Though maneuvering the sails carefully, we had little control of our ship and by about eight o'clock found ourselves again (to the dismay of every one), close to the largest of the Farallon Islands.\": 2,\n",
       " 'Just when our troubles were at their height there appeared a San Francisco coasting pilot-boat on the scene, which sent a man on board, who immediately ordered the changing of sails.': 2,\n",
       " 'Unfortunately there is a vast difference between the German mode of rigging and the American way, in consequence of which an American mariner seldom finds himself at home on a German sailing-vessel.': 3,\n",

       " 'He eats and drinks for a purpose; he works for a purpose; he builds his house, his town, his cities for a purpose, and San Francisco, above all others, I judge, is built for a purpose, through and through.': 0,\n",
       " 'You will understand this phrase better as you read along.': 3,\n",
       " 'The streets are straight and wide, because crooked, narrow lanes would not suit the commercial purpose; they are all cut at right angles, running North, West, East and South — for a purpose.': 2,\n",
       " 'How could a stranger possibly familiarize himself quickly with the location of a place in which he is interested in so large and mountainous a city, the houses of which, particularly in the outskirts, resemble anything but a continuous line and where the many vacant lots make it almost impossible to use numbers effectively?': 0,\n",
       " 'You commence to realize that the founders and early city fathers laid their plans for a purpose and, moreover, for a good one.': 3,\n",
       " 'Having read so far you will now reason thus: If San Francisco has wide, straight streets and large squares, it must be a beautiful city.': 2,\n",
       " 'Slowly, I pray you!': 0,\n",
       " 'Do not judge too hastily.': 3,\n",
       " 'This is a new country and San Francisco is of the latest birth, in what is commonly known as the \"Wild Western\" region.': 1,\n",
       " 'Everything consequently is yet done for a commercial purpose, and beauty, so far, counts for little.': 2,\n",
       " 'And still one has to admit San Francisco has its attractions.': 3,\n",
       " \"Though the appearance of the city, were I to describe a bird's-eye view from one of the hill tops is not a very symmetrical one, nor does it present to us the beautiful architecture of ancient Greece, but one finds therein a rare liveliness and an ever changing aspect.\": 2,\n",
       " 'San Francisco compares with Berlin as a bright, rosy-cheeked maiden might be compared with a marble Juno.': 4,\n",
       " 'No two houses have a similar front; not ten are alike in general architecture.': 4,\n",
       " 'Each house has its peculiarity, indicating the taste and nationality of its owner and is built in accordance with the requirements of the respective material used.': 0,\n",
       " 'One naturally finds the strangest contrasts of architectural products, mostly imitations of foreign ideas, brought hither from every civilized and uncivilized nation of the world.': 1,\n",
       " 'Buildings, representing the styles of Holland, Australia, East India, Germany, China, Belgium, North America, England, France, Chile, Switzerland and many other countries stand peacefully alongside of each other.': 4,\n",
       " 'The materials used differ as much as do the countries which their styles represent.': 1,\n",

       " 'The former you will find almost everywhere in this part of California, gold being — strange to say — to such a degree diffused throughout the whole soil in many localities that wherever you may wash a pan of dirt, be it in the woods or in a meadow, on the top of a hill, or in the valley, you will at least find one or two small \"scales\" of gold, or to use the common expression of the miners, you will find \"the color.\"': 1,\n",

       " 'But the further you go from the low land into the Sierra Nevada, the richer you find the soil; and dirt that pays 6, 8 or 10 cents or even a dollar to the bucket is even now no rarity in California.': 1,\n",
       " 'Unfortunately such localities are generally so far away from water that they cannot be worked.': 1,\n",
       " 'Grounds which are often exceedingly profitable, but which can be worked only during the rainy season, or with water brought there in an artificial way, are called Dry Diggings.': 2,\n",
       " 'Gold is not so much found in the upper region as further below on the rock — the \"bedrock\" — and to reach that, the miner has often to dig down a hundred feet and even more; it is, however, by no means certain that he will find gold there, or in sufficient quantity to pay him for the hard labor and the time spent in getting there.': 2,\n",
       " 'Often 3 or 4 men will work for a whole month on such a hole, and when they reach the bedrock they find perhaps 30 or 40 Dollars, which means that they have thrown away hard labor, time and money.': 1,\n",
       " 'The sinking of these shafts in the valleys and ravines is a lottery; but it offers the only chance here in California to become wealthy with one stroke; because out of such a shaft (they generally are 6 or 8 feet square), have been often taken forty or fifty thousand dollars.': 1,\n",
       " 'Gold at the bottom of such a hole, on the bedrock, is always found in coarse pieces of from one dollar to five or six hundred dollars each, and it lays there in the crevices and on the rock, so that all you have to do is to scrape it together with a knife.': 2,\n",
       " 'It is this prospect which, during the summer, draws every one up to the mountains; and so — should I succeed during that time in saving a few hundred dollars either on this or on any other bar — I, too, shall go up to the Dry Diggings and try my luck there.': 2,\n",

       " 'The ravines which drain the water from the springs to the river are often found to be rich in gold, and so it pays well at times to work them; but this also can only be done during the rainy season, because in the summer and even in the spring, they are perfectly dry.': 1,\n",
       " 'The gold found there is generally in fine scales, or in small pieces of the size of a pin-head, and is only found in the uppermost region, about 1 or 2 feet below the surface.': 1,\n",
       " 'The more rocky and the harder the ground, the more gold it usually contains; light soil with but few rocks in it will not pay wages, not once in a hundred times.': 2,\n",
       " 'And now to the Water Diggings or to the so-called River Bars.': 2,\n",
       " 'You can get the best idea what a bar is, if you think of the bleaching ground in Bartenstein; but instead of the grass, there are at the bar only sand and rocks, similar to the sea shore.': 2,\n",
       " 'Such bars, alternately larger and smaller, are found one after the other, on either one or the other side of the river, just as it changes its course, and they are on nearly all the rivers of North America wherever they emerge from the mountains, when they begin to flow less swiftly and consequently can deposit the sand and the stones which the rapid current has torn loose in the mountains.': 2,\n",
       " 'The higher up in the mountains, the smaller and the more rocky are the bars, and the more coarse and heavy is the gold found there — the further down the stream, the broader and the more sandy is the bar, and the finer and lighter the gold.': 2,\n",
       " \"You are aware that I have as yet not seen much of the different mining districts of California; but I feel confident that, if I succeed in giving you a good description of Long Bar, where I am working now, and of a miner's life and work, you can form a correct idea of the bars in general, because in the main they all resemble each other, and the life of a miner is the same on all of them.\": 4,\n",
       " 'Long Bar is one of the lowest bars on the right bank of the Yuba river, a tributary to the Feather river, and is distant from Marysville about 20 English miles; a very good and much frequented country road leads to that place.': 1,\n",
       " 'Long Bar extends for about a mile up the river and is divided into three parts, viz&dot: \"Big Bar,\" socalled on account of its former richness, miners making even as late as the last year from 12 to 20 Dollars per day; then \"the Flat,\" a level sandy piece of ground 200 or 300 yards wide, covered with a growth of short grass on such places as are not worked by miners, and where these find but little gold, seldom more than 2 cents to the bucket; and lastly the lower end of the bar — \"Island Bar\" — evidently formerly an island, since between it and the higher ground one can yet plainly see the old river bed, even now in autumn, winter and spring full of water.': 2,\n",
       " 'This old river bed is called \"the slough.\"': 2,\n",
       " 'The banks of this slough are covered with brush, just as the somewhat more elevated center of it, which, however, also shows a few stunted oaks and pines.': 2,\n",
       " 'Elsewhere on the island one will not notice anything but naked piles of rocks — desolation itself.': 3,\n",
       " 'The tents of the miners, the stores and boarding houses, are not put up on the bar itself, but upon higher ground, on the bank of the river, which is about as high as the \"Veilchenberge\" (Violet Hills) on the \"Neue Bleiche\" near Königsberg — and where they form a continuous irregular line, so that the whole looks like a village of tents — about 300 of them — picturesquely scattered and partly hidden among brushwood and trees.': 2,\n",
       " 'Behind the tents the ground rises again to a second terrace, about as high as the first, thus forming a gently sloping elevation covered with short grass, and here and there a bit of brushwood; the ridge itself being a constant change of gently undulating hills and dales, and the whole forming the outermost link between the Sierra Nevada and the vast, boundless savanna, where the mighty Sacramento — a stream as broad as the Elbe — in its slow course absorbs its numerous tributaries.': 2,\n",
       " 'One can hardly imagine such a variety of lovely landscapes as are shown in this part of the country, especially now, in the spring of the year, when numerous rivulets rush through the ravines between overhanging boughs, and the gigantic evergreen California oaks and aged pines show in their aromatic twigs the brightest verdure.': 2,\n",
       " 'The country is not what we call woody; the trees stand about 30 or 40 feet apart, so that their outer branches hardly touch each other.': 2,\n",
       " 'The ground between them is entirely free from underbrush, but is covered with a dense growth of soft grass, forming a carpet which is interwoven with the brightest and most fragrant flowers.': 2,\n",
       " 'These flowers which rival the flowers in your gardens in the splendor of their colors, but surpass them in fragrance, often cover the ground so completely that they even hide the grass; and in the cooling shade of these oaks one often walks for hundreds of yards, and walks literally on a carpet of flowers.': 2,\n",
       " 'This belt of undulating country, never losing its character, is crossed by beautiful rivulets, here meandering between low brushwood over a gravelly bed, or there rushing in cascades over moss grown rocks towards the Yuba.': 2,\n",
       " 'For miles and miles around us the country shows these charming features, which though on the whole always the same, constantly present themselves to the eye in a different and — if possible — more enchanting form.': 2,\n",
       " 'If I had to select some scenery near my old home, in order to give you an idea about the country surrounding Long Bar, I should select the Simser Valley near Meilsberg, where the \"holy\" lindentree stands; in looking at that scene there, think of gigantic oaks here, and of the indescribable aroma of millions of flowers, so strong that at times it almost overcomes you.': 3,\n",
       " 'But come with me; it is Saturday evening, and I wish to take my usual walk.': 1,\n",
       " 'We ascend to the second terrace above Long Bar, which I mentioned before, and follow a serpentine trail which, running through the most charming natural park, brings us in about fifteen minutes to the top of a high hill, a somewhat higher point than the surrounding country.': 2,\n",
       " 'It is covered with brushwood, through which we have to find our way ere we reach the summit; through this the bed-rock has forced its way in the shape of two mighty bowlders of granite, wonderfully resembling in shape and size the Borstenstein at Neu-Kuhren, only that they tower higher above you by about 15 feet.': 2,\n",
       " 'We climb up to the top of the larger of the two, and from here we have a good view of the surrounding country.': 2,\n",
       " 'Our view towards the North does not extend very far.': 2,\n",
       " 'Near us a small rivulet passes in its winding course on towards the Yuba, now in plain view falling over gray rocks, then disappearing among brush, to come to light again as a lakelet, bedded in banks of flowers, its crystal surface reflecting the purple clouds above.': 2,\n",
       " 'Another curve and it is again out of sight.': 0,\n",

       " 'The character of the landscape in this direction is melancholy, almost sad; nothing animate, no human habitation in sight; mountains upon mountains, and only high above in the air you may at times see an eagle, hardly visible to the naked eye, slowly sailing in circles in the clear atmosphere; or perhaps from yonder tree the shrill screech of a raven may at times reach your ear.': 0,\n",
       " 'Towards the South we have the whole bar before us from end to end.': 2,\n",
       " 'Among the gloomy, desolate-looking piles of rocks, which, however, at this moment, bathed in a rosy tint of the evening sun, appear in their best light, we see yet here and there an exceptionally industrious miner.': 2,\n",
       " 'The most of them, however, are at this moment climbing up to their tents, carrying in their arms the tin pans with the gold, which they have taken out during the day — their wages gained by hard labor.': 0,\n",
       " 'Nearer to us, on this side of the bar and glistening white among the green foliage, you see the tents; and out of the chimneys here and there you will notice the smoke curling up, a sign that the occupant is busy preparing his frugal evening meal.': 3,\n",
       " 'Yonder the Yuba — a river now in the spring fully as broad as the Pregel — lines the bar as with a band of silver, and its bank beyond with the same characteristics you observe on this side, ends the panorama in that direction.': 0,\n",
       " 'And now a look toward the West over the broad, level savanna, where the Yuba empties into the Feather river, and this again further on into the Sacramento.': 2,\n",
       " 'This immense plain extends almost without any interruption up to the chain of mountains, which line the Pacific coast, far beyond our horizon.': 1,\n",
       " 'The vista is broken by the \"Butes\" only — eight or ten conical mountains, six or eight hundred feet high, rising abruptly out of the plain between the Sacramento and Feather rivers, and close to one another, but separated by deep ravines, whose bottoms are densely wooded — the abode of numberless grizzly bears.': 2,\n",
       " 'I feel, nay I am convinced, that my description of the scenery here cannot impress you in such a manner as to do it justice.': 3,\n",
       " 'If, however, you were to read it on a mild, fair evening in summer, somewhere in the quiet, pleasant Simserthal, you might conceive a better idea of what it really is.': 3,\n",
       " 'Now let us return to the Bar.': 2,\n",
       " 'I told you before that gold is washed out by different kinds of machines.': 1,\n",
       " 'Here at the bar there are four different kinds in use.': 1,\n",
       " 'The Rocker or Cradle, the Bullrocker, the simple and the double Long Tom.': 2,\n",
       " 'Anyone who prefers to remain by himself and wants to do without a partner, has to use the rocker, because the last named three machines cannot be worked by one man alone, but require more hands.': 0,\n",
       " 'The rocker or cradle, as some call it, with which I, too, have worked, is a box 18 inches wide and 4½ or 5 feet long.': 2,\n",
       " 'It rests slightly inclining forward on two runners, or rockers, so that by means of a handle (a), which is fastened to its left side, it may easily be rocked just like a cradle.': 2,\n",
       " 'On top of the rear end, i e&dot, the higher end of the rocker, is a sieve (b), made of sheet iron about two feet long and of the same width as the rocker, which can be removed.': 2,\n",
       " 'Below this sieve and slanting toward the rear end, is placed the so-called \"apron\" (c), made of strong cotton cloth and fastened to a frame.': 0,\n",
       " 'The object of this is to conduct everything that goes through the sieve to the rear end of the rocker.': 2,\n",
       " 'The drawing here will help to make you understand that.': 0,\n",
       " 'The forward or lower end of the box is open, only a narrow lath — 1¼ or 1½ inches wide — is nailed across it at the bottom; this is called the \"riffle.\"': 2,\n",
       " 'The modus operandi is very simple.': 0,\n",
       " 'A bucketful of dirt, with stones and all, just as you have loosened it with the pick, is thrown on the sieve, and then while you set the rocker in motion with the left hand, with a dipper in your right you pour water over the dirt on the sieve.': 2,\n",
       " 'As soon as the soil is washed off the stones these are thrown out and a second bucket of dirt is thrown on the sieve, and this again is treated like the first, and so on until you have washed about 20 or 25 bucketfuls.': 2,\n",
       " 'By the motion of the rocker the gold and heavy sand are collected on its bottom, while the lighter stuff is washed off over the riffle; this lighter stuff we call \"tailings.\"': 2,\n",
       " 'The residue which has collected on the bottom of the rocker is now very carefully scraped together at the rear end of it, is then treated again to three or four washings, and now we have the gold mixed only with some black ferruginous sand, but free from all other matter; it is now taken up and thrown into a tin or sheet-iron pan — a pan about 4 inches deep, in diameter about 16 inches on top and 12 inches at the bottom.': 2,\n",
       " 'The last work before evening is then to wash in this pan the black sand off the gold, a procedure requiring much dexterity, the sand being almost as heavy as the gold itself, so that one not used to the work, is apt to wash away gold and sand together.': 2,\n",
       " 'Any grains of sand which, on account of their being too heavy, we cannot separate from the gold by washing, we get rid of by first drying the whole thoroughly; then we put it on a small tray and blow the sand away.': 2,\n",
       " 'In reading this description you will not think that our labor is as heavy as it really is.': 4,\n",
       " 'Believe me, it is as exacting, mechanical labor as can be done; and is intensely so to one not accustomed to manual labor.': 2,\n",
       " 'The hard stony soil has first to be loosened with a pick; then the larger stones — often so heavy that they can hardly be moved, have to be rolled aside; next the dirt must be shoveled together, and must then be carried to the rocker.': 2,\n",
       " 'Now consider that we have to remove the top dirt before we reach the soil in which we find the gold; (on the place where I am at work now I have to remove 5 or 6 feet of rocks — at times even more) that I have to carry daily 40 or 50 pails of water a distance of from 200 to 300 yards over rough, loose rocks, that we have to work in narrow holes or shafts from 6 to 10 feet deep, where one never feels a draught of air, but where he is exposed to a sun so hot that he can hardly touch the stones with his hand; if you think of that you will concede that to chop wood is in comparison with this, justly considered to be light work.': 2,\n",
       " 'But one gets used to everything, and so have I got used to this work, which now is not half as hard on me as it was at first, though I am able to do almost as much again as I did at first.': 0,\n",
       " 'But I have made it a rule not to over-exert myself; whenever I am tired or do not feel like working I stop; I always bear in mind that my health is my only capital, which I have to husband most carefully.': 4,\n",
       " 'Yet I am making more money than many others, because I attend to my work in an even way without hurrying or exerting myself too much.': 0,\n",
       " 'Almost of the same construction as the rocker above described is the \"bullrocker,\" only with this difference that it is larger, generally 2 feet wide and about 6 feet long, and that the iron sieve which covers the whole length of it is open at the lower end, so that the rocks after being washed will by the motion of the rocker drop off by themselves, and the sieve needs not to be emptied, by hand, as with the small rocker.': 2,\n",
       " 'The single \"Long Tom\" consists of a wooden box, open at the lower end, 12 or 15 feet long and about 12 inches wide — the so-called \"sluice box.\"': 2,\n",

       " 'About 15 inches below this sieve is placed the riffle box, which is of the same width, but about 8 feet long, and divided into two parts by nailing a piece of lath about 1½ or 1¾ inches wide across it; the rear portion is about 5 feet, the front portion about 3 feet long.': 2,\n",
       " 'It requires 3 men to work a Long Tom.': 0,\n",
